						<p>I am passionate about improving the American healthcare system by promoting transparency and improving the emotional relationships people have with their healthcare.<br><br>

Nothing fulfills me more than transforming complex, complicated ideas into clear, actionable strategies that help people live longer, healthier lives. Collaboration is key, and I strive to connect manufactures, payers, providers and consumers through solving multifaceted problems with technology.<br><br>

Key areas of interest: mobile, micro-location context, wearables, big data, social, cloud computing, ecommerce & 3-D printing. <br><br>

Based in NYC, I've spoken on healthcare topics on SiriusXM's The Focus Group, am the owner of a YouTube health channel, was the winner of Merck’s Social Health Hack, and am a former speaker at NY’s Social Media Week and the HiMSS and Biotech conferences. I'm also a community producer at BRIC Media Arts Center.<br><br>

I have led the strategic and tactical development of web, mobile and ecommerce properties a for a variety of businesses including: UnitedHealthcare, Merck, J&J, and others.<br><br>

My formal education is focused in research, systems thinking and business. I hold a BA in Sociology and Anthropology from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, an MA in Sociology from Minnesota State University; I am PhD/ABD in Sociology from the London School of Economics, and have an MBA from Villanova University. <br><br>
